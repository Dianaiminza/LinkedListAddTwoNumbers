# Initialization:

- dummyHead: A dummy node to simplify handling edge cases.
- current: Pointer to build the result linked list.
- carry: Variable to store carry-over value.

# Loop through l1 and l2:

- Sum the values from the current nodes of l1, l2, and carry.
- Calculate new carry and the value for the new node.
- Move the pointers to the next nodes in l1 and l2.
  
# Final Carry Check:

- If there's any remaining carry, add it as a new node.

# Return Result:

Return the node next to dummyHead, which is the start of the resulting linked list.
This solution handles the addition digit by digit, manages the carry-over appropriately, and constructs a new linked list representing the sum in reverse order.
